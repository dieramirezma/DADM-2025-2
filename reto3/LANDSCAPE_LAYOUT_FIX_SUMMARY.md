# Landscape Layout Fix - Summary

## Issue Fixed
The horizontal/landscape orientation layout was not user-friendly because:
- The game board was positioned on the right side
- The board appeared "broken at the middle" due to poor space allocation
- Statistics were taking up too much space on the left

## Solution Implemented

### Layout Structure Changes
**Before (Problematic):**
```
[Statistics & Status - Left] [Game Board - Right]
        (Weight: 1)              (Weight: 1)
```

**After (Fixed):**
```
[Game Board - Left]    [Statistics & Status - Right]
    (Weight: 2)               (Weight: 1)
```

### Key Improvements Made

#### 1. **Swapped Positions**
- **Game Board**: Moved from right side to left side
- **Statistics**: Moved from left side to right side

#### 2. **Improved Space Allocation**
- **Game Board**: Increased weight from 1 to 2 (66% of screen width)
- **Statistics Panel**: Reduced weight to 1 (33% of screen width)
- This gives more space to the board, preventing it from appearing "broken"

#### 3. **Optimized Text Sizes for Landscape**
- **Statistics title**: Reduced from 18sp to 16sp
- **Status text**: Reduced from 18sp to 14sp
- **Label text**: Reduced to 12sp for better fit
- **Statistics numbers**: Kept at 18sp for visibility

#### 4. **Adjusted Spacing and Padding**
- Reduced margins and padding for more compact design
- Changed margin between statistics rows from 8dp to 6dp
- Reduced padding from 16dp to 12dp in statistics container

#### 5. **Enhanced Visual Design**
- Added background to status text for better definition
- Maintained proper padding and margins for touch-friendly interface
- Preserved color coding for different statistics

## Result
The landscape orientation now provides:
- ✅ **Game board on the left side** (as requested)
- ✅ **Statistics and status on the right side** 
- ✅ **Proper board proportions** - no more "broken" appearance
- ✅ **Optimized space usage** - 2:1 ratio (board:stats)
- ✅ **Better usability** in horizontal orientation

## File Modified
- `app/src/main/res/layout-land/activity_main.xml`

The layout now works seamlessly for horizontal orientation while maintaining all the state preservation and multi-orientation support functionality.
